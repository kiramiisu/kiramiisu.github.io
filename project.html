You can duplicate or do a "save as" with this file to start each of your main website pages, and use the example-layouts.html file for code snippets and reference. You can start one project page with this, and then duplicate that page for the rest of your project pages.

The homepage html file of every website should always be named index.html.

        In order to keep our CSS as manageable as possible, we're starting with 3 separate stylesheets.
        You should not edit reset.css at all.
        You can edit layout.css to match your specific column/row grid rules. Try to keep all basic structural rules here.
        You can use style.css for all general UI styles.
